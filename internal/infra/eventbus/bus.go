// Package eventbus is the domain-event bus riding the asynq message queue
// (ADR-001 step-6 preparation). Producers append events to the outbox inside
// their domain transaction; the publish pump hands unpublished events to the
// broker and marks them published on successful enqueue; the queue worker
// delivers each event to every subscriber of its topic, with the broker
// owning retries, backoff and the dead-letter archive. Delivery is
// at-least-once and subscribers are expected to be idempotent (the inbox
// pattern). Replacing asynq with another broker changes only the Publisher
// adapter and the worker shell.
