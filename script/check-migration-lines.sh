# golang-migrate stores one integer version in schema_migrations and Up() only
# applies migrations numbered above it. A database that followed the LTS line to
# version V therefore never receives a migration numbered below V, so the feature
# line must satisfy two things for an LTS -> feature upgrade to be complete:
#
#   1. every migration on the LTS line also exists here, under the same number,
#      so the upgrade does not lose an LTS schema fix; and
#   2. every migration that exists only here is numbered above the band the LTS
#      line draws from, so none of them can be silently skipped by a database
#      that is already past that number.
#
# Hence the reserved bands: LTS fixes stay below FEATURE_BAND_START, feature work
# starts at it.
